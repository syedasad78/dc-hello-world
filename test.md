# Dev Container Hello World

This is a Hello World Go example that uses:

* [Dev Containers](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/developer-experience/devcontainers/)
* [SLE BCI](https://registry.suse.com/static/bci/golang/index.html) golang container for both a build step and Dev Container environment
* Multi-stage builds

This is sometimes used when demonstrating [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io).
